# Interview prep for SSE role
So the plan is to crack a couple of good companies in the span of next 4-6 months.\
We broadly have 4 major components when we are preparing for SSE role interviews.

### Coding Round
For most of the companies we don't need to do 1000 leetcode questions.\
After going through the articles and videos I have come to conclusion that we need to understand patterns and how to tweak them according to the question.

We can follow anyone of the following in beginning to identify the patterns
- Grokkng the coding Interview
- neetcode.io
- Striver SDE sheet

For extensive preparation we can go through some questions to practice from Final 450 questions sheet

That would be our aim as it would provide a higher possibility of coming accross a question that we have already solved.

### LLD Round
For LLD round we have to focus on following things 
* Design Patterns
* Class and Objects
* Case Studies for common problems

For case studies we can focus on Object Oriented Design Patterns by educative.io.

### HLD
For HLD we the topics and syllabus is very vast but for starters we can start with 
- Alex Xu's books
- Educative.io Grokking system Design and Grokking Advance system Design.
- Gaurav Sen Video, ByteByteGo mini blogs and clips
